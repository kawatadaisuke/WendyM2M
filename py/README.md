## Code

## run_WendyM2M.py

 Python code to run Wendy M2M. 

## WendyM2M_readfile.ipynb

 Notebook for testing to read the target disk file and run M2M.

## Generate_disk.ipynb

 Notebook for generating a target disk and save it in a file 'target_disk.h5'.

## wendypy_test.py

 Notebook for testing wendypy.py.

## wendypy.py

 1D approximate nbody version of Wendy in python. 


## WendyM2M_XomegaXnm_rhov2obs_perturbed.ipynb

 Notebook for WendyM2M with an external potential taking into account number/mass density ratio, Xnm, and applying to a perturbed disk. The observational constraints are density and the square of velocity only. 

## WendyM2M_XomegaXnm_vobs_perturbed.ipynb

 Notebook for WendyM2M with an external potential taking into account number/mass density ratio, Xnm, and applying to a perturbed disk. The observational constraints include the mean of v. 


## WendyM2M_Xnm_perturbed.ipynb

 Notebook for WendyM2M with an external potential taking into account number/mass density ratio, Xnm, and applying to a perturbed disk.

## WendyM2M_Xnm.ipynb

 Notebook for WendyM2M with an external potential taking into account number/mass density ratio, Xnm

## WendyM2M_XOmega.ipynb

 Notebook for WendyM2M with a background potential and fitting omega. 


## WendyM2M_VerticalImpact.ipynb

 Notebook for WendyM2M to the target disk perturbed by a vertical satellite impact. 

## Wendy4Daisuke.ipynb

 Notebook from Morgan Bennett for an example of a vertical satellite interaction model. 

## WendyM2M_NonAdiabaticImpact.ipynb

 Notebook for WendyM2M to the target disk constructed from a non-adiabatic impact.
